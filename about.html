    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Jingle Composer is an interactive music composition tool that allows users to easily make little songs and save them. The idea was inspired by the town
        song creation process in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing">Animal Crossing</a> video games created by Nintendo. The games
        allow users to compose a short song that is played throughout their town, and I, being a musician, have always enjoyed using it to recreate songs I like,
        or to come up with fun little tunes of my own. I wanted to make a website that recreated this functionality and allowed users to save the different songs
        that they came up with.

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>
        The musical staff you see on the compose page is actually a grid of buttons. When you click on a button, it saves the corresponding pitch and where the
        note is rhythmically. When you hit play, the notes are played in sequence according to their order and pitch on the staff.
